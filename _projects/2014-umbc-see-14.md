# The UMBC Senior Exit Exhibition is the annual exhibition that showcases the work of graduating seniors from the Visual Arts Program.

In preparation for the 2014 exhibition, I was selected by the Visual Art Dept. Faculty to design a poster advertising the show across the Fine Arts Building and UMBC Campus.

The project quickly grew from just a poster design into creating branding for the event, assisting with the layout of the exhibition and the development of a responsive website.
