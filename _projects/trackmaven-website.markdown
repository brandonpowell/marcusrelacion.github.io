Over the course of the last 11 months, I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to design and develop for the [TrackMaven](http://trackmaven.com/) marketing site.

Under the guidance of [Wade Hammes](https://twitter.com/whammes), a Front-End Developer Maven at TrackMaven I was able to build up my front-end skills in the following areas: HTML, CSS3, JS, jQuery, PHP, and Wordpress. I was also introduced to using build tools to automate the development process, primarily through the use of Gulp.

## ROI of TrackMaven

In the Summer of 2015, the ROI of TrackMaven [page](http://trackmaven.com/roi-of-trackmaven/) was added to the marketing site. Working alongside the marketing department, the goal of this page was to show the ROI and benefits of using TrackMaven in a clear, concise landing page.

The page was built using HTML and CSS.

## Homepage Development

In December 2015, I was tasked with building TrackMaven's newly redesigned [homepage](http://trackmaven.com/). The redesign was led by [Laura McGuigan](https://twitter.com/grafxnerd) and the goal of the redesign was to better land potential customers using updated copy across the page that better explained how TrackMaven could be beneficial for their companies. 

The page was built inside Wordpress, making use of Advanced Custom Fields as well as PHP, CSS, JS, jQuery.
