  For the 2014 exhibition, I was selected by design staff to create and design a poster advertising the show. The project grew from only designing a poster to an actual branding project which included printed collateral, assisting with the layout of the exhibition in the Center for Art Design and Visual Culture, and the development of responsive website.

  Throughout the duration of the project I collaborated with fellow classmates at different stages.

  I would like to thank [Michael Muccioli](https://twitter.com/michaelmuccioli), [Andrew Gallagher](https://twitter.com/ndrwg), and [Kirsten Green](https://twitter.com/kirstengreen_) for assisting me throughout the duration of this project.

  ## Exhibition Planning

  One of the initial problems I was tasked with solving was deciding on a layout that would best showcase the design students work. In addition to displaying the work, the work had to be grouped by class as well as class level.

  Similar to showcasing work in a portfolio, I decided on making the beginning and end the highlights of the design section. This meant showcasing Typography III and Graphic Design IV, due to these being the capstone courses of the program.
