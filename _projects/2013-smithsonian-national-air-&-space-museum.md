# In the Summer of 2013, I was selected from a broad pool of applicants to become an intern with the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum.

Over the course of my 3 month internship with the museum, I was tasked with completing a variety of design projects that ranged from page layouts, iconography and illustration, wayfinding and navigation, and fabrication.

In addition to being able to learn new skills through real-time problem solving, I was also introduced to the concepts and ideas of designing for a wide range of visitors and taking into account different needs these visitors might need accommodated.

Below are two of the projects that I had the opportunity to work on with the exhibition design team:

## Hawaii By Air

I designed three flip books that detailed the early travels of Mark Twain, Isabella Bird, Richard F. Bradley and Helen A. Hagerman to Hawaii. The introduction of the ADA rules and regulations, which must be adhered to in order to accommodate visitors was a challenge I had to overcome early on in the internship and particularly with these flip books.

## Moving Beyond Earth

For this project, I illustrated a set of icons that would be used in a voting booth that prompted visitors to donate coins into individual tubes based on their answers. The voting booth panels would have four illustrations, with the slots sitting directly beneath them. The panels would easily be interchangeable depending on the question that was being asked.
